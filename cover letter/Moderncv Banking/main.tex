I am writing to you today because I am interested in the VizQL Software Engineer position with Tableau based in the Seattle greater area. As a student in Oregon State University's post-baccalaureate program, I have gained experience in C, C\textsuperscript{++}, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, and MASM Assembly language. I have also worked with Node.js and MySQL. I am comfortable with Linux/Unix envioronments, git version control, vim, and gdb. Though I have been employed full-time as a commercial driver throughout my time in this program, I have maintained a 4.0 GPA. I have been able to do this because I truly love learning about computer science. I am eager to bring that passion and energy to my professional career.

In the Oregon State University BeaverHacks Winter 2018 Hackathon, a team of two other students and I created a C\textsuperscript{++} console journaling application. After the judges tabulated their scores, we were thrilled to discover that we had not just won the C\textsuperscript{++} console category, but that we took first place overall. That experience cemented my love for coding and for building something great with a team. Our submission can be found \textcolor{red}{\href{https://www.github.com/jkbartos/rewind-revitalize}{here}}. 

Please also see my other projects and experience which is detailed on my resume.

Thank you for your time and your consideration. I am excited about this opportunity, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
