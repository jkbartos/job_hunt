I am writing to you today because I am interested in in the Software Engineer Intern postion as posted on the Viasat careers website. I am a student seeking a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science through Oregon State University's post-baccalaureate program. Through that program, I have gained experience in C, C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, and MASM Assembly language. In Javascript, I worked with node.js, express, sessions, mysql, and handlebars. I have also  worked in linux/unix-like environments with vim, git, and gdb. Though I have been employed full-time as a driver and as a teaching assistant, I have maintained a 4.0 GPA in my coursework so far. I am accustomed to working very hard and giving all of myself to the task at hand. I am confident that I can be a helpful and passionate addition to your team for this summer.

I enjoy new challenges and working on a team to meet them. I competed in a hackathon put on by the Oregon State University BeaverHacks club. Our team of three entered the competition in a C++ console application category made to welcome new student programers into a hackathon, but we ended up winning overall first place. It was a very rewarding experience in developing a project with a group of people. Our submission, Rewind Revitalize, can be found \textcolor{red}{\href{https://devpost.com/software/rewind-revitalize}{here}}, and our github repo can be found \textcolor{red}{\href{https://github.com/jkbartos/rewind-revitalize}{here}}.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am excited about this opportunity, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
