I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineering Internship at Snowflake Computing. My performance in school, experience teaching computer science, and my passion for solving problems and learning new technologies makes me an exceptional candidate for this position. Through my coursework and personal side projects, I have demonstrated aptitude in key skills sought by Snowflake including Linux, Bash scripting, SQL, computer architecture, algorithms, and data structures as well as the use of best practices in writing C, C++, and Python. 
 
As a teaching assistant for introduction to computer science at Oregon State University, I read, debug, and critique code written by my students. I also communicate technical and stylistic criticisms effectively. In doing so, I have sharpened my code reading and debugging skills. I have helped teach new students the introductory curriculum in C\textsuperscript{++} for 3 quarters. However, as of the Fall 2019 quarter, the course curriculum is taught in Python. During the transition from C\textsuperscript{++} to Python, I assisted in proofing, testing, and debugging the new course materials.
 
At BeaverHacks Winter 2018, an OSU student club hackathon event, a team consisting of two other students and I built a C\textsuperscript{++} console-based journaling application for mindfulness. We incorporated user accounts, simple data encryption, and a feature that displays a random happy memory to the user. We competed against 14 other projects mostly created by more experienced students, so we were astounded to find that we won first place overall. Though this is no longer my most technically complex project, I am very proud of it. It represents the first time I jumped into coding head-first and experienced the thrill of making something with a team. Later, I joined the OSU Hackathon Club as an officer to help offer the same experience to other students. A link to the GitHub repository for my team's project and my other projects can be found on my resume.
 
At the time of my acceptance into my current degree program, I had little coding experience. Despite holding a physically-demanding full-time job and filling a teaching assistant role while taking classes, I have maintained a high level of performance in my education. I believe the principal reason for this is that I am extremely driven and passionate about learning new technologies. Out of necessity, I also developed excellent time-management and task prioritization skills.

Thank you for considering me for the Software Engineering Internship. Please contact me for any additional information. I am eager to learn more about this position and to bring my enthusiasm, experience, and desire to learn to Snowflake Computing.
