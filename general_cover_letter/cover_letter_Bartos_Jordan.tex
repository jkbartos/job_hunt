I am writing to express my interest in the Flight Software Engineer Internship at The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. My 4.0 GPA, experience teaching computer science, and my passion for solving problems and learning new technologies makes me an exceptional candidate for this position. Through my coursework and personal side projects, I have demonstrated aptitude in key knowledge-sets sought by JPL including Linux, multithreading, Bash scripting, computer architecture, algorithms, and data structures as well as the use of best practices in writing C, C++, and Python. 
 
As a teaching assistant for introduction to computer science at Oregon State University, I read, debug, and critique code written by my students. In doing so, I have sharpened my code reading and debugging skills. I have helped teach new students the introductory curriculum in C\textsuperscript{++} for 3 quarters. However, as of the Fall 2019 quarter, the course curriculum is taught in Python. During the transition from C\textsuperscript{++} to Python, I assisted in proofing, testing, and debugging the new course materials.
 
At BeaverHacks Winter 2018, an OSU student club hackathon event, a team consisting of two other students and I built a C\textsuperscript{++} console-based journaling application for mindfulness. We incorporated user accounts and simple data encryption. We competed against 14 other projects mostly created by more experienced students, so we were astounded to find that we won first place overall. This inspired me to join the OSU Hackathon Club as an officer to help offer the same experience to other students. A link to the GitHub repository for my team's project and my other projects can be found on my resume.

Though my time is largely occupied by work, school, and TA/Hackathon Club duties, I enjoy working on side-projects and learning new technologies in my free time. I have built data acquisition systems with Arduino, made slackbots, built a website, and programmed various other small projects in my freetime. Coding, problem-solving, and building useful things is a passion for me.

Thank you for considering me for this internship. Please contact me for any additional information. I am eager to learn more about this position and to bring my enthusiasm, experience, and desire to learn to The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
